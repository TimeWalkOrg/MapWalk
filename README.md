# MapWalk
An open-source app for leaving map-based suggestions to others

This app allows users to "highlight" areas on maps to later share with friends.  Users could highlight "Pretty" areas of town with the Green highlighter, "Shopping" areas with Blue, and "places to avoid" (boring, dangerous) with Red.  Once a map is highlighted, it can be shared to a friend who also uses this app.
